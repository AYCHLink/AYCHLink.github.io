      <description><![CDATA[Andreas Antonopoulos recently came out with a great video on why he thinks that "Bitcoin is the next Bitcoin". Even though Andreas is mostly a Bitcoin maximalist, a lot of the arguments he makes can actually be applied to Nano, so I decided to make a video about it :)<br><br>I love Andreas and his videos, but it's pretty funny how similar his views are to the Nano community's. I know he doesn't like Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies, but overall he aligns pretty closely with us:<br><br>Utility over store of value<br><br>The importance of decentralization<br><br>Being censorship-resistant<br><br>The focus on peer-to-peer cash<br><br>The importance of good UX]]></description>

Community Awards are specific for the sub but they will not give the user any Reddit premium. However, the post gets a fancy Nano icon and 20% of the Award cost goes to the community chest. Those coins can be spent only by a moderator to give the "Nano Approved Hero" (the icon far to the right) to a user of our choice, which will bring 3 months of Reddit premium to that user!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The median has been 0.65-0.67 seconds for weeks according to repnode.org

Now the median from the past 24 hours is at 0.49! I'm waiting for the day-to-day graph to update. This with only 37% of the network nodes running on the latest protocol version and big reps like Brainblocks still on v18. I guess more nodes upgrading will have some kind of influence on the speed. Following the trend with excitement!]]></description>
