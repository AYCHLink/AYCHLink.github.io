Community Awards are specific for the sub but they will not give the user any Reddit premium. However, the post gets a fancy Nano icon and 20% of the Award cost goes to the community chest. Those coins can be spent only by a moderator to give the "Nano Approved Hero" (the icon far to the right) to a user of our choice, which will bring 3 months of Reddit premium to that user!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The latest 24h median is down 0.27sec, compared to 0.67sec seen with previous node version. That's about 2.5x faster! The version before that it was at 10sec and even that was impressive. If you don't know how small this number is I can tell you it's faster than it takes for me to ping a computer in Tokyo, Japan from Sweden which is absolutely crazy. During those 270ms a transaction is broadcasted, saved in a database, voted on, reaching global consensus across the network and confirmed.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The median has been 0.65-0.67 seconds for weeks according to repnode.org

Now the median from the past 24 hours is at 0.49! I'm waiting for the day-to-day graph to update. This with only 37% of the network nodes running on the latest protocol version and big reps like Brainblocks still on v18. I guess more nodes upgrading will have some kind of influence on the speed. Following the trend with excitement!]]></description>
