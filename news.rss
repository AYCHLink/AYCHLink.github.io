Pippin is the first wallet of its kind that is 100% compatible with the developer wallet (aka “node wallet”) APIs. Of course the node wallet isn’t recommended for a lot of use cases, but a lot of developers use it anyway — because as you might expect, it’s the easiest solution and it generally works well enough. One of the goals of Pippin is to provide a production-ready, external key management solution that’s incredibly easy to setup and maintain.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Andreas Antonopoulos recently came out with a great video on why he thinks that "Bitcoin is the next Bitcoin". Even though Andreas is mostly a Bitcoin maximalist, a lot of the arguments he makes can actually be applied to Nano, so I decided to make a video about it :)<br><br>I love Andreas and his videos, but it's pretty funny how similar his views are to the Nano community's. I know he doesn't like Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies, but overall he aligns pretty closely with us:<br><br>Utility over store of value<br><br>The importance of decentralization<br><br>Being censorship-resistant<br><br>The focus on peer-to-peer cash<br><br>The importance of good UX]]></description>
