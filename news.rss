      <description><![CDATA[Lately I've been working on a somewhat niche 2D multiplayer game (turn-based racing does sound niche doesn't it?) called Raesonic. For a while I planned to add premium cosmetics which could only be obtained with Nano, but I wanted the quality of the content and gameplay value to be a little better. It's still in early development stages but today is the day.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Part of the work that we've been doing on the backend of our services has been to make it easier to deploy and scale NANO nodes without much of a headache and notably without Docker. Although Docker is an excellent tool for cross-platform deterministic build- and runtime environments, we currently use the functional Nix/NixOS/NixOps (https://nixos.org) stack in our development and production environments for the many benefits it provides. For those of you who aren't familiar with the Nix ecosystem, it can be briefly summarised as an operating system and package manager that ensures deterministic system configurations on an OS-level, ensuring rock-solid reliability and the elimination of many sysadmin-related headaches as well as much of the spaghetti code that arises from Kubernetes/Terraform/etc. stacks.]]></description>

This means that it can only be connected to via tor and not on the normal web.<br><br>This was a simple project to learn a bit more about tor and setting up hidden services. Currently it allows you to look up accounts and blocks. There are a number of features still to add including account histories and also exploring the possibility of having a send block form for pre-signed blocks.<br><br>This is not a privacy system, the service does not log accounts/blocks that are searched for and the clients are anonymous however Nano is not private in the same way as privacy currencies. The aim of this service is to allow people to access the nano block lattice via the tor network.]]></description>

I built a website called weacceptcryptocurrency.com which lists merchants online that accept crypto as payment.<br><br>I know there are already NANO-specific sites, but this will have a much wider reach as we begin to rank on Google for general crypto-related terms.<br><br>Another problem this site solves is I link whenever possible to the crypto payments page on the merchant site, because often there will be specific discounts or instructions for those looking to pay with cryptocurrency, which aren't easily found from the homepage.<br><br>I know the site looks shitty and is a beta-version, so please let me know how you think I could improve it.<br><br>Also let me know of merchants I'm missing that accept NANO as payment if you know of any. There is no fee for merchants to be listed on this site, nor will there ever be.<br><br>This website will always be free and free of ads for users. I believe in crypto long term which is why I'm committing time to this!]]></description>

It's a site where you can wager any amount of Nano against another player in a coinflip. Whatever side the coin lands on, the winner takes all. Currently, it is in beta testing and has a 0% fee. It has a provably fair system with instant deposits and withdrawals. I would really appreciate it if you guys could take a look and leave feedback about the site.]]></description>

One of the goals of Pippin is to provide a production-ready, external key management solution that’s incredibly easy to setup and maintain.]]></description>
