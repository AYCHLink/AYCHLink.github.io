Do you think something important is missing? Just clone repo at [Github](https://github.com/Joohansson/nanolinks) , edit news.md and make a pull request. You can also contact me at [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Joohansson/). All content will be evaluated.


### Voting Representative
<div class="first-para" markdown="1">
If you have a nano account you can help decentralize the network by choosing a representative other than the official reps that is default. Best is to choose someone you really trust. If you want you can choose [This Node](https://nanonode.ninja/account/xrb_1iuz18n4g4wfp9gf7p1s8qkygxw7wx9qfjq6a9aq68uyrdnningdcjontgar) that has been running 24/7 since Feb 2018. I intend to keep it running for a long time and upgrade hardware when necessary! Graphical stats of this monitor [here](https://node.nanolinks.info/nano.html).
